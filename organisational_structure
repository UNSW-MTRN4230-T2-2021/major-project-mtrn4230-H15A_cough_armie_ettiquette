We will be using a flat organisational structure for our company.  

Decision Making Processes: 
Before a critical decision is made by any one team member, they should communicate their potential decision to the rest of the group, and seek feedback. The final decision will be made with the input of the group. 

Who Reports to Whom:
All team members will report to our project manager/CEO. It should be noted that we will have a chat group online which all team members will be able to access and post to. Our project manager will monitor the activity in this group and may post about important deadlines. It is the responsibility of each team member to keep themselves up to date with the group chat and to communicate with each other as necessary.
