# Project Management Plan

## Change Management Plan

As the project goal is complex, there will likely be revisions to the project. Such revisions can include modifications to the milestones, redefining scope with accordance to timeline or even modifications to technical implementations already in place such as switching out a software algorithm or changing the physical attributes of the system.
The proposals of technical variations to the project should be first discussed within the development team. This ensures everyone involved in the implementation of the project is aware of the change. Engineering managers must be present at such meetings to gather proposed changes and understand why these changes are being proposed. Engineering managers can also propose changes to the milestone and assist in redefining scope with accordance to the team’s progress and budget.
Once, the proposed changes are identified and unanimously agreed on, the engineering manager will then act as a representative for the team and bring the proposed changes to a meeting with upper management including members such as the CTO and the CEO. Once the changes ensure the team is still within budget and is still able to the meet original timeline of the project, the changes are approved.

## Scope Management Plan

As part of the project, the agile methodology will be used to manage and plan the work involved in the project. As part of this methodology, project scope is defined as a list of user stories which are high level requirements representing a small chunk of the work involved to finish and deliver the project. Before work is started, a list of user stories is generated and put into a list of unfinished tasks known as the backlog. User stories are prioritized in the backlog in accordance to business value, complexity and costs. The user stories are completed incrementally in sprints.
A sprint is a period of time, usually two weeks cycles, where work is completed and verified. Before a sprint is begun, user stories are chosen to be completed in the upcoming sprint based on priority. Estimations are done for each user story to ensure the amount of work chosen to be completed in the sprint is reasonable. One the sprint has begun, the scope of work for the sprint cannot be changed unless absolutely necessary. At the end of each sprint, the scope is verified by reviewing the sprint outcome, ensuring the outcome is accepted by stakeholders. The backlog is then refined in accordance to the sprint outcome to ensure the desired outcome of the project is produced.

## Milestones and Deliverables 

The company will deliver the following list of milestones for this project. 
1.	Test which materials will and will not work well with the suction cup. 
2.	Using the test results select a material that will work on the suction cup. Ensure materials are within project budget.  
3.	Build the game board and pieces (X tiles and O tiles).  
4.	Program to identify colored (white) game pieces on a black game board.  
5.	Program to place tiles on the correct position on the game board.
6.	Simulate the program and test (OpenCV) 
7.	Algorithm to detect the layout of game board (including X and O pieces). 
8.	Algorithm that uses strategies to decide next move. 
9.	Create test cases for testing the algorithms. 
10.	Implement algorithm on different scenarios (AI to play the game).
11.	Test play on the robot arm. 
12.	Make final improvements based on test results. 

## Schedule Management Plan

A Gantt chart will be used to manage the schedule of the project. It will include each of the deliverables in order as well as estimations of the deliverable’s completion time. The initial version of the project Gantt chart is committed in group Github repository under ‘nethmini/PMP’ branch.
