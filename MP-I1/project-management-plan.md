# Project Management Plan

## Project Scope 
The scope of the project includes planning, design, development and testing of a program that plays tic-tac-toe against a human player which will be run on a certain robotic arm. Also, in the scope of project is to create the physical components of a tic-tac-toe game including X and O tiles, a black playing mat and the playing board. The program will need to meet its functional requirements and must adhere to a certain standard of quality. The scope also covers maintaining thorough documentation and ensuring enough information for end users to execute the program and troubleshoot common problems. The scope of this project includes adding safety measures on the program to reduce hazards for the program operator. 

The project will be executed internally and not outsourced. The scope of the project does not include variations for program to be run on different operating systems. The scope does not include developing the robotic arm or developing updates and revisions.

## Quality Management Plan
The outcome of the project should meet a certain quality expectation and throughout the project, this must be ensured so that the final solution meets this expectation. Change in expectations may happen throughout the project and there needs to be a way of managing that. This section focuses on ways to manage quality, their expectation, changes along the way, and implementation along with assurance. This should be a maintainable management plan. 

Project requirements will be a result of stakeholder research by product owners which will be translated into deliverables. These deliverables will be passed to the project manager, who will define quality expectations for each deliverable and have it approved by the product owner. Once approved the project manager will communicate the deliverables, their functional requirement and quality expectations to respective teams. Each team will have one member acting as quality assurance to ensure the teams deliverable meet its requirement and is up to quality standards. Quality assurance for each team will utilize specific tools and follow consistent methodology to ensure quality standard are met. In case of quality concerns, first consult the team, if it is not resolved then communicate to project manager. 

The aim of this quality management plan (QMP) is to have clear criteria of what is the expected quality of the product and have a straightforward way to communicate these expectations to teams implementing the functionalities. Project managers work closely with teams and change is easily communicated then project managers simply get approval from an owner. The short chain is put in place to reduce time required to deal with changing expectations in an agile project.

## Scope Management Plan
As part of the project, the agile methodology will be used to manage and plan the work involved in the project. As part of this methodology, project scope is defined as a list of user stories which are high level requirements representing a small chunk of the work involved to finish and deliver the project. Before work is started, a list of user stories is generated and put into a list of unfinished tasks known as the backlog. User stories are prioritized in the backlog in accordance to business value, complexity and costs. The user stories are completed incrementally in sprints.

A sprint is a period of time, usually two weeks cycles, where work is completed and verified. Before a sprint is begun, user stories are chosen to be completed in the upcoming sprint based on priority. Estimations are done for each user story to ensure the amount of work chosen to be completed in the sprint is reasonable. One the sprint has begun, the scope of work for the sprint cannot be changed unless absolutely necessary. At the end of each sprint, the scope is verified by reviewing the sprint outcome, ensuring the outcome is accepted by stakeholders. The backlog is then refined in accordance to the sprint outcome to ensure the desired outcome of the project is produced.

## Risk Management Plan
A methodical approach is used to identify project risks, where the team identifies potential hazards at each stage of the project schedule. The risks associated with these hazards are determined before being scored and ranked in terms of severity. The most important risks are added to the project schedule to ensure mitigation plans are established by the team prior to a stage’s commencement. Every two weeks, the team will review the risks and associated monitoring methods. If changes to the risk management plan are approved, the project manager updates the risk management plan according to the change management plan.

Upon project completion, the team will gather to analyze the risk management process. Improvements to this process are identified and noted for future projects.

## Communication Management Plan
A communications management plan is required to ensure that all team members and stakeholders know relevant contact details throughout the project’s duration. The plan aims to record the process, type, and expectations of communications. This is implemented with a communication matrix to easily identify who is communicating, what information is being communicated, when communications are taking place, and to whom members are communicating. The communication matrix may need to be updated during the project’s duration due to changes in personnel, project scope, or other reasons. If changes to the communication management plan are proposed, the project manager is responsible for managing these changes and distributing updated plans to the team and stakeholders, as per the change management plan.

Communication Type | Description | Frequency | Format | Participants/Distribution | Deliverable | Owner
------------------ | ----------- | --------- | ------ | ------------------------- | ----------- | -----
Project Team Meeting | Lab meeting to discuss current status and future work. | Weekly | <ul><li>In Person</li><li>Conference call</li></ul> | Project Team | <ul><li>Updated Work Progress</li><li>Meeting Minutes</li></ul> | Project Manager
Status Report | Consulting stakeholder (Max) about current status | Weekly | In Person | <ul><li>Project Team</li><li>Stakeholders</li></ul> | Status Report | Project Manager
Technical Design Meetings | Discuss technical designs for project | As required | <ul><li>In Person</li><li>Conference call</li></ul> | Team Technical Members | Meeting Minutes | Project Manager

A project team directory is included in the plan to provide contact information and roles of all team members for stakeholders.

Meetings:

The Project Manager will distribute a meeting agenda to team members on the day prior to each meeting. All team members are responsible for reviewing the agenda prior to the meeting. During meetings, each member ensures they adhere to agenda times, and the technical writer will record task distribution to the team. Meeting minutes will be distributed live.

Informal Communication:

The Messenger application is used for all informal communication. GitHub Pull Requests are used when pushing to higher branches, requesting review from relevant team members. It is the responsibility of the requester to ensure the reviewer is aware of the request. The team members tasked with reviewing pull requests will complete the review within one day.
