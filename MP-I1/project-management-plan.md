# Project Management Plan

## Change Management Plan

As the project goal is complex, there will likely be revisions to the project. Such revisions can include modifications to the milestones, redefining scope with accordance to timeline or even modifications to technical implementations already in place such as switching out a software algorithm or changing the physical attributes of the system.

The proposals of technical variations to the project should be first discussed within the development team. This ensures everyone involved in the implementation of the project is aware of the change. Engineering managers must be present at such meetings to gather proposed changes and understand why these changes are being proposed. Engineering managers can also propose changes to the milestone and assist in redefining scope with accordance to the team’s progress and budget.

Once, the proposed changes are identified and unanimously agreed on, the engineering manager will then act as a representative for the team and bring the proposed changes to a meeting with upper management including members such as the CTO and the CEO. Once the changes ensure the team is still within budget and is still able to the meet original timeline of the project, the changes are approved.

## Scope Management Plan

As part of the project, the agile methodology will be used to manage and plan the work involved in the project. As part of this methodology, project scope is defined as a list of user stories which are high level requirements representing a small chunk of the work involved to finish and deliver the project. Before work is started, a list of user stories is generated and put into a list of unfinished tasks known as the backlog. User stories are prioritized in the backlog in accordance to business value, complexity and costs. The user stories are completed incrementally in sprints.

A sprint is a period of time, usually two weeks cycles, where work is completed and verified. Before a sprint is begun, user stories are chosen to be completed in the upcoming sprint based on priority. Estimations are done for each user story to ensure the amount of work chosen to be completed in the sprint is reasonable. One the sprint has begun, the scope of work for the sprint cannot be changed unless absolutely necessary. At the end of each sprint, the scope is verified by reviewing the sprint outcome, ensuring the outcome is accepted by stakeholders. The backlog is then refined in accordance to the sprint outcome to ensure the desired outcome of the project is produced.

## Risk Management Plan

A methodical approach is used to identify project risks, where the team identifies potential hazards at each stage of the process. The risks associated with these hazards are then determined before being scored and ranked in terms of severity. The most important risks are added to the project schedule to ensure mitigation plans are established by the team prior to a stage’s commencement. Every two weeks, the team will review the risks and associated management plans. The project manager updates the risk management plan according to the change management plan.
Upon project completion, the team will gather to analyze the risk management process. Improvements to this process are identified and noted for future projects.

## Communication Management Plan

A communications management plan is required to ensure that all team members and stakeholders know contact details throughout the project’s duration. The plan aims to record the process, type, and expectations of communications. This is implemented with a communication matrix to easily identify who is communicating, what information is being communicated, when communications are taking place, and to whom members are communicating. The communication matrix may need to be updated during the project’s duration due to changes in personnel, project scope, or other reasons. If changes to the communication management plan are proposed, the project manager is responsible for managing these changes and distribute updated plans to the team and stakeholders, as per the change management plan.

Communication Type | Description | Frequency | Format | Participants/Distribution | Deliverable | Owner
------------------ | ----------- | --------- | ------ | ------------------------- | ----------- | -----
Project Team Meeting | Lab meeting to discuss current status and future work. | Weekly | In Person<br/>Conference call | Project Team | Updated Work Progress<br/> Meeting Minutes | Project Manager
Status Report | Consulting stakeholder (Max) with current status | Weekly | In Person | Project Team<br/>Stakeholders | Status Report | Project Manager
Technical Design Meetings | Discuss technical designs for the project | As required | In Person<brb/>Conference call | Team Technical Members | Meeting Minutes | Project Manager

A project team directory is included in the plan to provide contact information and roles of all team members for stakeholders.
