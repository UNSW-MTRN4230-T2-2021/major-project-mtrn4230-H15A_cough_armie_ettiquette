# Project Management Plan

## Project Scope 
The scope of the project includes planning, design, development and testing of a program that plays tic-tac-toe against a human player which will be run on a certain robotic arm. Also, in the scope of project is to create the physical components of a tic-tac-toe game including X and O tiles, a black playing mat and the playing board. The program will need to meet its functional requirements and must adhere to a certain standard of quality. The scope also covers maintaining thorough documentation and ensuring enough information for end users to execute the program and troubleshoot common problems. The scope of this project includes adding safety measures on the program to reduce hazards for the program operator. 

The project will be executed internally and not outsourced. The scope of the project does not include variations for program to be run on different operating systems. The scope does not include developing the robotic arm or developing updates and revisions.

## Change Management Plan
As the project goal is complex, there will likely be revisions to the project. Such revisions can include modifications to the milestones, redefining scope with accordance to timeline or even modifications to technical implementations already in place such as switching out a software algorithm or changing the physical attributes of the system.
The proposals of technical variations to the project should be first discussed within the development team. This ensures everyone involved in the implementation of the project is aware of the change. Engineering managers must be present at such meetings to gather proposed changes and understand why these changes are being proposed. Engineering managers can also propose changes to the milestone and assist in redefining scope with accordance to the team’s progress and budget.
Once, the proposed changes are identified and unanimously agreed on, the engineering manager will then act as a representative for the team and bring the proposed changes to a meeting with upper management including members such as the CTO and the CEO. Once the changes ensure the team is still within budget and is still able to the meet original timeline of the project, the changes are approved.

## Scope Management Plan

As part of the project, the agile methodology will be used to manage and plan the work involved in the project. As part of this methodology, project scope is defined as a list of user stories which are high level requirements representing a small chunk of the work involved to finish and deliver the project. Before work is started, a list of user stories is generated and put into a list of unfinished tasks known as the backlog. User stories are prioritized in the backlog in accordance to business value, complexity and costs. The user stories are completed incrementally in sprints.
A sprint is a period of time, usually two weeks cycles, where work is completed and verified. Before a sprint is begun, user stories are chosen to be completed in the upcoming sprint based on priority. Estimations are done for each user story to ensure the amount of work chosen to be completed in the sprint is reasonable. One the sprint has begun, the scope of work for the sprint cannot be changed unless absolutely necessary. At the end of each sprint, the scope is verified by reviewing the sprint outcome, ensuring the outcome is accepted by stakeholders. The backlog is then refined in accordance to the sprint outcome to ensure the desired outcome of the project is produced.

## Milestones and Deliverables 

The company will deliver the following list of milestones for this project. 
1.	Test which materials will and will not work well with the suction cup. 
2.	Using the test results select a material that will work on the suction cup. Ensure materials are within project budget.  
3.	Build the game board and pieces (X tiles and O tiles).  
4.	Program to identify colored (white) game pieces on a black game board.  
5.	Program to place tiles on the correct position on the game board.
6.	Simulate the program and test (OpenCV) 
7.	Algorithm to detect the layout of game board (including X and O pieces). 
8.	Algorithm that uses strategies to decide next move. 
9.	Create test cases for testing the algorithms. 
10.	Implement algorithm on different scenarios (AI to play the game).
11.	Test play on the robot arm. 
12.	Make final improvements based on test results. 

## Schedule Management Plan

A Gantt chart will be used to manage the schedule of the project. It will include each of the deliverables in order as well as estimations of the deliverable’s completion time. The initial version of the project Gantt chart is committed in group Github repository under ‘nethmini/PMP’ branch.
The project will be executed internally and not outsourced. The scope of the project does not include variations for program to be run on different operating systems. The scope does not include developing the robotic arm or developing updates and revisions.

## Quality Management Plan
The outcome of the project should meet a certain quality expectation and throughout the project, this must be ensured so that the final solution meets this expectation. Change in expectations may happen throughout the project and there needs to be a way of managing that. This section focuses on ways to manage quality, their expectation, changes along the way, and implementation along with assurance. This will be details of a maintainable and scalable management plan. 

Project requirements will be a result of stakeholder research by project managers which will be translated into deliverables. These deliverables will be passed to the software leads (senior programmers), who will define quality expectations for each deliverable and have it approved by the project manager. Once approved the software leads will communicate the deliverables, their functional requirement and quality expectations to respective teams. Everyone in the team is responsible for verifying their work is up to quality expectation. Additionally, Each team will have one member acting as quality assurance to ensure the teams deliverable meet its requirement and is up to quality standards. Quality assurance for each team will utilize specific tools and follow consistent methodology to ensure quality standard are met. In case of quality concerns, first consult the team, if it is not resolved then communicate to senior developers. 

The project should always have clear criteria of what is the expected quality of the product and have a straightforward way to communicate these expectations to teams implementing the functionalities. Software leads work closely with teams and change is easily communicated then software leads simply get approval from project manager. Always confirm that everyone has a shared understanding of the current quality expectation.
