# Project Management Plan

## Milestones and Deliverables 
The company will deliver the following list of milestones for this project. 
1.	Test which materials will and will not work well with the suction cup. 
2.	Using the test results select a material that will work on the suction cup. Ensure materials are within project budget.  
3.	Build the game board and pieces (X tiles and O tiles).  
4.	Program to identify colored (white) game pieces on a black game board.  
5.	Program to place tiles on the correct position on the game board.
6.	Simulate the program and test (OpenCV) 
7.	Algorithm to detect the layout of game board (including X and O pieces). 
8.	Algorithm that uses strategies to decide next move. 
9.	Create test cases for testing the algorithms. 
10.	Implement algorithm on different scenarios (AI to play the game).
11.	Test play on the robot arm. 
12.	Make final improvements based on test results.
