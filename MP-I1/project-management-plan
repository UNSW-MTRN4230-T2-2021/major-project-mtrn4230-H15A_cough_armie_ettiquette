## Risk Management Plan
A methodical approach is used to identify project risks, where the team identifies potential hazards at each stage of the process. The risks associated with these hazards are then determined before being scored and ranked in terms of severity. The most important risks are added to the project schedule to ensure mitigation plans are established by the team prior to a stageâ€™s commencement. Every two weeks, the team will review the risks and associated management plans and update them if required.
Upon project completion, the team will gather to analyze the risk management process. Improvements to this process are identified and noted for future projects.
