## Change Management Plan
As the project goal is complex, there will likely be revisions to the project. Such revisions can include modifications to the milestones, redefining scope with accordance to timeline or even modifications to technical implementations already in place such as switching out a software algorithm or changing the physical attributes of the system.
The proposals of technical variations to the project should be first discussed within the development team. This ensures everyone involved in the implementation of the project is aware of the change. Engineering managers must be present at such meetings to gather proposed changes and understand why these changes are being proposed. Engineering managers can also propose changes to the milestone and assist in redefining scope with accordance to the team’s progress and budget.
Once, the proposed changes are identified and unanimously agreed on, the engineering manager will then act as a representative for the team and bring the proposed changes to a meeting with upper management including members such as the CTO and the CEO. Once the changes ensure the team is still within budget and is still able to the meet original timeline of the project, the changes are approved.

## Scope Management Plan

As part of the project, the agile methodology will be used to manage and plan the work involved in the project. As part of this methodology, project scope is defined as a list of user stories which are high level requirements representing a small chunk of the work involved to finish and deliver the project. Before work is started, a list of user stories is generated and put into a list of unfinished tasks known as the backlog. User stories are prioritized in the backlog in accordance to business value, complexity and costs. The user stories are completed incrementally in sprints.
A sprint is a period of time, usually two weeks cycles, where work is completed and verified. Before a sprint is begun, user stories are chosen to be completed in the upcoming sprint based on priority. Estimations are done for each user story to ensure the amount of work chosen to be completed in the sprint is reasonable. One the sprint has begun, the scope of work for the sprint cannot be changed unless absolutely necessary. At the end of each sprint, the scope is verified by reviewing the sprint outcome, ensuring the outcome is accepted by stakeholders. The backlog is then refined in accordance to the sprint outcome to ensure the desired outcome of the project is produced.

## Schedule Management Plan

A Gantt chart will be used to manage the schedule of the project. It will include each of the deliverables in order as well as estimations of the deliverable’s completion time. The initial version of the project Gantt chart is committed in group Github repository under ‘nethmini/PMP’ branch.
The project will be executed internally and not outsourced. The scope of the project does not include variations for program to be run on different operating systems. The scope does not include developing the robotic arm or developing updates and revisions.

## Quality Management Plan
The outcome of the project should meet a certain quality expectation and throughout the project, this must be ensured so that the final solution meets this expectation. Change in expectations may happen throughout the project and there needs to be a way of managing that. This section focuses on ways to manage quality, their expectation, changes along the way, and implementation along with assurance. This will be details of a maintainable and scalable management plan. 

Project requirements will be a result of stakeholder research by project managers which will be translated into deliverables. These deliverables will be passed to the software leads (senior programmers), who will define quality expectations for each deliverable and have it approved by the project manager. Once approved the software leads will communicate the deliverables, their functional requirement and quality expectations to respective teams. Everyone in the team is responsible for verifying their work is up to quality expectation. Additionally, Each team will have one member acting as quality assurance to ensure the teams deliverable meet its requirement and is up to quality standards. Quality assurance for each team will utilize specific tools and follow consistent methodology to ensure quality standard are met. In case of quality concerns, first consult the team, if it is not resolved then communicate to senior developers. 

The project should always have clear criteria of what is the expected quality of the product and have a straightforward way to communicate these expectations to teams implementing the functionalities. Software leads work closely with teams and change is easily communicated then software leads simply get approval from project manager. Always confirm that everyone has a shared understanding of the current quality expectation.

## Risk Management Plan
A methodical approach is used to identify project risks, where the team identifies potential hazards at each stage of the project schedule. The risks associated with these hazards are determined before being scored and ranked in terms of severity. The most important risks are added to the project schedule to ensure mitigation plans are established by the team prior to a stage’s commencement. Every two weeks, the team will review the risks and associated monitoring methods. If changes to the risk management plan are approved, the project manager updates the risk management plan according to the change management plan.

Upon project completion, the team will gather to analyze the risk management process. Improvements to this process are identified and noted for future projects.

## Organisational Structure
We will be using a flat organisational structure for our company.

Decision Making Processes: Before a critical decision is made by any one team member, they should communicate their potential decision to the rest of the group, and seek feedback. The final decision will be made with the input of the group.

Who Reports to Whom: All team members will report to our project manager/CEO. It should be noted that we will have a chat group online which all team members will be able to access and post to. Our project manager will monitor the activity in this group and may post about important deadlines. It is the responsibility of each team member to keep themselves up to date with the group chat and to communicate with each other as necessary.

## Staffing Management Plan
For this project, we will use a flat organisational structure.

Staffing requirements for this project are the following:

Project Manager (1 position): Responsible for all management of the project. The Project Manager is responsible for planning and managing all the work activities of the project. They are tasked with communicating with team members regarding progress and deadlines of each milestone or deliverable, project progress tracking and staffing. Required to send written documentation to the technical writer.

Senior Programmer (1 position): Responsible for oversight of all coding and programming tasks for the project. Responsible for liasing with the project manager to write reports and discuss plans and progress for all software tasks.

Notes: As our company's team is limited to only five people, these roles are not strictly exclusive. All team members will be expected to contribute to programming and writing up documentation (as well as any other general tasks that may arise) to some degree.

## Communication Management Plan
A communications management plan is required to ensure that all team members and stakeholders know relevant contact details throughout the project’s duration. The plan aims to record the process, type, and expectations of communications. This is implemented with a communication matrix to easily identify who is communicating, what information is being communicated, when communications are taking place, and to whom members are communicating. The communication matrix may need to be updated during the project’s duration due to changes in personnel, project scope, or other reasons. If changes to the communication management plan are proposed, the project manager is responsible for managing these changes and distributing updated plans to the team and stakeholders, as per the change management plan.
